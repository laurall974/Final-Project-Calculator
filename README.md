# Final Project - Calculator - Cloud Computing  

CÃ©line LIU & Laura LLINARES

## :star2: Goal
Create a calculator container that connects to a mongodb which runs on another container, fetches data and shows it on a webpage on your host machine.

Add to your application a feature, which adds the images on your host and loads it on a web page. Any changes in this folder should be shown by refreshing the web page. (by using a bind mount) 

## :construction_worker_woman: Prerequisites
Be sure to have docker and docker compose installed, check with
```
docker --version
docker-compose --version
```

## :scissors: Fork the repository
And then clone it, go to the directory with:
```
git clone git@github.com:<your_github_username>/<project-name>.git
cd <project-name>
```

You can also pull the image from the Docker Hub repository 
```
docker pull laurall974/calculator-app
```

## :chart_with_downwards_trend: Without Docker compose
1. Pull the docker images (mongo)
```
docker pull mongo
```
It will pull the latest version as the default one without giving a tag, if you dont have it already.

2. Create a bridge network for the containers to connect to!
```
docker network create --driver bridge <your_bridge_network_name>
```

3. Start the MongoDB container by specifying the network and the port
```
docker run -d --network <your_bridge_network_name> --name <your_mongo_container_name> -p 27017 mongo
```

4. Build the Docker image for the Flask application
```
docker build -t <your_new_image_name> .
```

5. Create the docker Volume
```
docker volume create <your_volume_name>
```

6. Start the Calculator container, specifying the network, bind mount, volume
```
docker run -d 
  --network <your_bridge_network_name> 
  --name <your_new_container_name> 
  -p 8080:8080 
  -v /path_to_your_directory/<project-name>/Pictures:/app/images <your_new_image_name> 
  -v <your_volume_name>:/data/db mongo 
```

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: With Docker compose
Use the command
```
docker compose up -d
```
## :rocket: Let's go
The list of calculations is available on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) for the `Dockerfile` and . [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) for `docker-compose.yml`.

:warning: You may not see the calculations training list immediatly since it needs time to be loaded, so you need to refresh the page.

Any changes in the Pictures folder's image will be shown by refreshing the web page [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
:warning: BUT you must rename the picture "my-image.png"

You can also verify mounts : 
```
docker inspect <your_mongo_container_name>
```
## Implemented features ( :heavy_check_mark: )

Your Project should have:

:heavy_check_mark: At least two containers, one being a database of your choice

:heavy_check_mark: At least one well-documented Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml (with comments)

:heavy_check_mark: A volume to make your database persistent and also a bind mount

:heavy_check_mark: An explicit bridge network for the communications of your containers

:heavy_check_mark: A Docker Hub public repository for your docker images

:heavy_check_mark: A GitHub repository with instructions to run your project (The collaboration of
both contributors should be visible)

:heavy_check_mark: At least a dependency requiring the installation of an external library/package

:heavy_check_mark: Both teammates should explain the technical architecture and how they have collaborated

:heavy_check_mark: Your presentation skills are also evaluated (5 pts) the precision and the accuracy
of your words are important

:heavy_check_mark: During this presentation you should demonstrate your knowledge of all keys
concepts seen in this course

:heavy_check_mark: You are asked to use a medium for your presentation (PowerPoint)

:heavy_check_mark: The language is English (Non-negotiable)
